## Two Implementations — Important Distinction

There are two implementations of the RIO governance engine:

1. **ONE app** (rio-one.manus.space) — The live, production implementation. Built with React + tRPC + Express inside the Manus webdev framework. This is where the full governed execution loop runs end-to-end today. This is the product.

2. **Gateway server** (rio-system/gateway/) — A standalone Express server intended for self-hosted deployment. This is a separate implementation that shares the same concepts but is not yet feature-complete. This is for enterprises who want to run RIO on their own infrastructure.

When checking status, the ONE app is the canonical reference for what works. The gateway is the distribution target for what will be packaged.

## What Is In Progress

- Google Drive knowledge base reorganization (Jordan)
- Gateway server hardening for standalone deployment (future)
- Agent onboarding and testing (Brian + team)

## What Is Blocked

_Nothing currently blocked._

## What Is Next

- Protocol Packs (domain-specific policy profiles — engineering, legal, medical, financial)
- Learning Loop feedback (learning events improving future Bondi recommendations)
- PWA push notifications (requires VAPID key setup)
- Witness service (independent verification network)
- Gateway server completion for self-hosted deployment
- Developer tutorials and quickstart guides (Damon)
- Solution architecture examples (Andrew)
